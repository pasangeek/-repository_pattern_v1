###This repository demonstrates how to implement the repository pattern with Retrofit, DAO, and Coroutines in Kotlin.

- What is the Repository Pattern?
The repository pattern is a design pattern that separates the data access layer of an application from the business logic layer. This means that all data-related operations (such as querying a database or reading from a file) are abstracted away from the rest of the application, allowing the business logic to be more modular and easier to maintain.


**IN THIS REPOSITORY, I'VE DEMONSTRATED HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE REPOSITORY PATTERN WITH RETROFIT, DAO, AND COROUTINES IN KOTLIN. BY SEPARATING THE DATA ACCESS LAYER FROM THE BUSINESS LOGIC LAYER, WE CAN CREATE MORE MODULAR AND MAINTAINABLE CODE. BY USING COROUTINES, WE CAN PERFORM ASYNCHRONOUS NETWORK AND DATABASE OPERATIONS WITHOUT BLOCKING THE MAIN THREAD.**

Note that this is just a basic implementation of the repository pattern and can be expanded upon based on your specific use case. It's important to tailor your implementation to your application's needs and ensure that it is efficient and maintainable.
